code for Kaggle assignment

I have tried many different methods in the code file, including Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, LGBM , DNN and so on. So the code may seem not clean. Finally, I chose two version of codes from DNN as my final submission. 
I didn't commented all the code that wasn't needed, but if you wanna get my result, you can just choose to run the final DNN part to predict after the data preprocessing.

Programming language: Python
Some packages needed: sklearn, XGBoost, Keras.
